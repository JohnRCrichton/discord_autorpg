# autorpg

a discord bot game that players can idle and earn experience/fight monsters/gain items/level up/other fun stuff

## Registering
üìù By joining the server you are automatically in the game and playing! Just be online and watch your progress!

## Idling
‚åõ Play the game just by being online! All online states count, whether it's online, idle, do not disturb, etc. You start at level 1 and will gain a new level after 10 minutes, increasing the time needed with each level. After reaching level 60, you receive a buff and will briefly gain levels faster before flattening back out to normal speed. Being offline will net you no experience, so don't fall behind! 

## World Map
üåé The world of AutoRPG is a 500 x 500 grid map that players are continuously wandering. Every second, you move in a random direction or not at all. If you collide with another player, you will engage in a head-to-head battle following normal challenge rules. Some quests require you to reach a certain point on the map in order to complete. You may also come across some special loot on certain points in the world.

## Challenging Players (PvP)
‚öî On each level up, you will challenge a random player (or whoever you ran into on the map) who is also online. The total score of your weapon and armor levels are put against the other player's total score. If yours is larger, you win and a reward of time is taken off your clock. If you lose, a portion of time is added on. The opponent's time does not change for either winning or losing.

## Quests
üèûÔ∏è Periodically you may be called by the celestial beings on a quest. Only one quest per server can be active. All the chosen adventurers must be online to be eligible. There is a total time that must be collectively idled to reach the quest's end (12-15 hours * the # of chosen players), and all players on the quest will contribute to that total. If they do not reach the total time in 24 hours then a penalty of 15% is applied to everyone in the realm. However, if they succeed then the clock of everyone in the realm is boosted by 20% to the next level, granted they are online at the time of completion.

## Random Events
‚ö° The journey through the realm is treacherous, and random events may occur. This can be either a positive outcome, which takes time off your clock, or a negative outcome, which adds time on. However, positive events are much more likely to happen at a ratio of 70% to 25% chance, roughly. There is also a 5% chance to be blessed by the almighty, which greatly removes time off your clock and is always positive.

## Item Drops
üó°Ô∏è On each level up, you will find a random piece of equipment. This can be either a weapon or shield equally. The level of the equipment is determined by your level with some variation based on your luck. Each item is also given a modifier based on how rare the item is. Also, the more rare the item, the higher the level of the equipment. Extremely rare artifacts can also drop, marked by the @Unique modifier, and can significantly increase equipment level scores.

## Alignment
üé≠ Players have a chance to align themselves to either good or evil. A good alignment will award players a 10% boost to their equipment strength when challenging opponents. They also have a slightly higher chance at getting good events to occur. Evil players on the other hand get a 20% penalty to their equipment, however they have the chance to steal items from who they win against in a challenge, with the exception of @Unique items. If the loser of the fight has higher level of items, they are swapped with the evil player's lower gear. High risk, high reward.
